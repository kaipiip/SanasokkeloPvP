# SanasokkeloPvP game

A game about two aliens trying to learn to understand the writing of humans by recognizing words from magazines (a 15x15 grid of capital letters). You can play solo or with a friend on Windows. The game, documentation and comments are in Finnish. Made with Jypeli game programming library (C#) for a programming course 1 at University of Jyväskylä as my first ever program.
